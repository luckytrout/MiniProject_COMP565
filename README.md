# Project Write-Up
#
# Introduction:
# I will be creating a building-block application using Unity Game Engine.
#The product should be complete with a simple UI for allowing the user
# to select from three types of geometric shapes and to select from three 
# types of materials for their building-block. The user should be able 
# to point and click with their mouse to place their shape on a base platform,
# and should be able to stack their shapes on top of each other. The user
# should also have the option to destroy/explode those shapes.
#
# Approach:
# With some experience, I approached Unity with an idea of how to implement
# the basic features that I was tasked with creating. I considered the 3D space
# that Unity offers and how I would need to utilize interactions from the user 
# and use raycasting to my advantage. I was prepared to implement textures, user 
# interface, user controls, and core game mechanics. At the beginning, I felt 
# comfortable with Unity but I was humbled by the different areas that this 
# project made me tackle.
# 
# Challenges faced during the implementation:
# Some challenges that I faced were certain features that I needed to create
# such as the visual guide for displaying the selected geometry to the user,
# and to visually explode the generated shapes. I had trouble at times with 
# scripting and debugging. I also would often complicate things by attempting 
# a method of implementation that may actually be more complicated than necessary.
# When finally arriving at a method that does work, could seem like it was right
# under my nose.
# 
# Lessons learned:
# The resources provided in class about raycasting were most important for this 
# project and I had a much deeper understanding of what it is, how it works, and
# how I can use it practically, just by developing this application. I also have a 
# better understanding of Unity in how to program GameObjects more efficiently and 
# how to make them interact with each other more effectively.
